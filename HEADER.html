<h3>MRMS Hourly Zip Files</h3>

<p>This service maintains about a 30 TB near-term archive of
NCEP <a href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/mrms/">MRMS</a> data.  Since
local storage is limited, older content is offloaded to Iowa State's box.com
presence called "CyBox".  Through some magic, redirection URIs are maintained
here to allow scripted access against Cybox.</p>

<p>Filename Convention: <code>YYYY/mm/dd/YYYYmmddHH24.zip</code>.  For example,
    a filepath named <code>2022/01/01/2022010112.zip</code> would be the MRMS
    content between 12 and 13 UTC on January 1, 2022.</p>

<p>When browsing content on this server, you may see a zip file with only
    about 70 byte size reported.  This file is a virtual file that is redirected
    to CyBox on request.

<h4>Example wget command to download file.</h4>

<pre>wget -L -O 2021060100.zip https://mrms.agron.iastate.edu/2021/06/01/2021060100.zip</pre>

<p>The `-L` is important to handle the redirect and the `-O` is import to get the
    downloaded filename right after getting redirected.</p>

<h4>Example python code to download two days worth of content.</h4>

<pre>
import datetime
import subprocess

# Get hourly files from June 1 and June 2 2021
now = datetime.datetime(2021, 6, 1, 0)
utc_end = datetime.datetime(2021, 6, 3, 0)

while now < utc_end:
    cmd = (
        'wget -L -O ' + now.strftime('%Y%m%d%H') + '.zip ' +
        'https://mrms.agron.iastate.edu/' + now.strftime('%Y/%m/%d/%Y%m%d%H') + '.zip'
    )
    print(cmd)
    subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True)
    now += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)
